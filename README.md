This project contains a comprehensive analysis of customer satisfaction trends for the first quarter of 2022. The dataset includes customer satisfaction scores, product details and case information, helping to identify key factors affecting satisfaction levels across various regions, products and case owners.

The primary goal is to investigate the factors contributing to a noticeable decline in the Overall Technician Satisfaction rating, starting in January 2022 and to provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction going forward.
